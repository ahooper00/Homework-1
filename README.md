# Homework-1

The aim of this homework was to ensure that all of the links on the website work, the CSS file is properly commented, and the HTML and CSS files are semantically sound. 

HTML
The <div> sections at the top and bottom of the page were changed to <header> and <footer> to make it more semantic and easier to read, instead of allocating class elements to these <div> sections.
I adjusted the id and class selectors for the links so that they corresponded properly with the CSS file and are easier to follow. 
The style property within the <span> tag in the <h1> was added in the html instead of having it in the css file.

CSS
I adjusted the CSS selectors corresponding to the adjusted <header> and <footer> in the HTML file, to ensure the styling works.
The selector names were also adjusted to make the file easier to read and keep it semantic.
The display property under the <li> tag was changed from inline-block to inline.
The id tags in the html tags were changed from class(.) to id(#).
